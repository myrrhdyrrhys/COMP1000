# COMP1000
Unix and C Programming (Year 1, Semester 2)

A SE unit designed to have us familiarise ourselves with the Unix environment provided on pretty much all of the lab computers on Curtin campus, as well as give us an introduction to C, which was a bit of a step back from Java which I had solely been using up until that point.

The unit went into depth on topics about C starting with how programs and files are structured and interact with each other for a C project (e.g. header .h files, .c files and makefiles), to later describe the wonder world of pointers and memory allocation/de-allocation. :)!
The unit also touched briefly on other concepts such as using the debugger gdb and how to do a little shell scripting.
